I takes your privacy seriously (no, seriously). To better protect your privacy I provide this privacy policy notice explaining the way your personal information is collected and used. (To be honest, this site is mostly statically generated. The only people/organizations that are going to collect data is probably google. (Because I use analytics on this site to see what people click on, but don't worry it's anonymous (as far as google tells us)))

## Collection of Routine Information

This website track basic information about their visitors. This information includes, but is not limited to, IP addresses, browser details, timestamps and referring pages. None of this information can personally identify specific visitors to this website. The information is tracked for routine administration and maintenance purposes. (This section is provided mostly so that in the case the google search indexing is collecting info, I don't seem like I'm stealing any of your info)

## Cookies

Where necessary, this website uses cookies to store information about a visitor’s preferences and history in order to better serve the visitor and/or present the visitor with customized content (when there is any. Most of this site is static anyways).

## Advertisement and Other Third Parties

Advertising partners and other third parties may use cookies, scripts and/or web beacons to track visitors activities on this website in order to display advertisements and other useful information. Such tracking is done directly by the third parties through their own servers and is subject to their own privacy policies. This website has no access or control over these cookies, scripts and/or web beacons that may be used by third parties. Learn how to [opt out of Google’s cookie usage](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

## Links to Third Party Websites

I have included links on this website for your use and reference. I arm not responsible for the privacy policies on these websites. You should be aware that the privacy policies of these websites may differ from my own (duh).

## Security

The security of your personal information is important to me, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

This Privacy Policy is effective as of 05/01/2025 and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.

I reserve the right to update or change my Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically. If I make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, I will notify you either through the email address you have provided me (if you ever decide to), or by placing a prominent notice on my website.
